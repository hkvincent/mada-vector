Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.\\[1\\] Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Methods to generate this mapping include neural networks,\\[2\\] dimensionality reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix,\\[3\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\] probabilistic models,\\[6\\] explainable knowledge base method,\\[7\\] and explicit representation in terms of the context in which words appear.\\[8\\] \n\nWord and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing\\[9\\] and sentiment analysis.\\[10\\] \n\n## Development and history of the approach\\[edit\\]\n\nIn distributional semantics, a quantitative methodological approach to understanding meaning in observed language, word embeddings or semantic feature space models have been used as a knowledge representation for some time.\\[11\\] Such models aim to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The underlying idea that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" was proposed in a 1957 article by John Rupert Firth,\\[12\\] but also has roots in the contemporaneous work on search systems\\[13\\] and in cognitive psychology.\\[14\\] \n\nThe notion of a semantic space with lexical items (words or multi-word terms) represented as vectors or embeddings is based on the computational challenges of capturing distributional characteristics and using them for practical application to measure similarity between words, phrases, or entire documents. The first generation of semantic space models is the vector space model for information retrieval.\\[15\\]\\[16\\]\\[17\\] Such vector space models for words and their distributional data implemented in their simplest form results in a very sparse vector space of high dimensionality (cf. curse of dimensionality).",

Reducing the number of dimensions using linear algebraic methods such as singular value decomposition then led to the introduction of latent semantic analysis in the late 1980s and the random indexing approach for collecting word cooccurrence contexts.\\[18\\]\\[19\\]\\[20\\]\\[21\\] In 2000, Bengio et al. provided in a series of papers titled \"Neural probabilistic language models\" to reduce the high dimensionality of word representations in contexts by \"learning a distributed representation for words\".\\[22\\]\\[23\\]\\[24\\] \n\nA study published in NeurIPS (NIPS) 2002 introduced the use of both word and document embeddings applying the method of kernel CCA to bilingual (and multi-lingual) corpora, also providing an early example of self-supervised learning of word embeddings \\[25\\] \n\nWord embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in Lavelli et al., 2004.\\[26\\] Roweis and Saul published in _Science_ how to use \"locally linear embedding\" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures.\\[27\\] Most new word embedding techniques after about 2005 rely on a neural network architecture instead of more probabilistic and algebraic models, after foundational work done by Yoshua Bengio\\[28\\] and colleagues.\\[29\\]\\[30\\] \n\nThe approach has been adopted by many research groups after theoretical advances in 2010 had been made on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model, as well as after hardware advances allowed for a broader parameter space to be explored profitably. In 2013, a team at Google led by Tomas Mikolov created word2vec, a word embedding toolkit that can train vector space models faster than previous approaches.",

In other words, polysemy and homonymy are not handled properly. For example, in the sentence \"The club I tried yesterday was great!\", it is not clear if the term _club_ is related to the word sense of a _club sandwich_, _clubhouse_, _golf club_, or any other sense that _club_ might have. The necessity to accommodate multiple meanings per word in different vectors (multi-sense embeddings) is the motivation for several contributions in NLP to split single-sense embeddings into multi-sense ones.\\[32\\]\\[33\\] \n\nMost approaches that produce multi-sense embeddings can be divided into two main categories for their word sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based.\\[34\\] Based on word2vec skip-gram, Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG)\\[35\\] performs word-sense discrimination and embedding simultaneously, improving its training time, while assuming a specific number of senses for each word. In the Non-Parametric Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (NP-MSSG) this number can vary depending on each word. Combining the prior knowledge of lexical databases (e.g., WordNet, ConceptNet, BabelNet), word embeddings and word sense disambiguation, Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA)\\[36\\] labels word-senses through an unsupervised and knowledge-based approach, considering a word's context in a pre-defined sliding window. Once the words are disambiguated, they can be used in a standard word embeddings technique, so multi-sense embeddings are produced.",

These embeddings better reflect the multi-sense nature of words, because occurrences of a word in similar contexts are situated in similar regions of BERT’s embedding space.\\[41\\]\\[42\\] \n\n## For biological sequences: BioVectors\\[edit\\]\n\nWord embeddings for _n-_grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for bioinformatics applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad.\\[43\\] Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad\\[43\\] suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns. ## Game design\\[edit\\]\n\nWord embeddings with applications in game design have been proposed by Rabii and Cook\\[44\\] as a way to discover emergent gameplay using logs of gameplay data. The process requires to transcribe actions happening during the game within a formal language and then use the resulting text to create word embeddings. The results presented by Rabii and Cook\\[44\\] suggest that the resulting vectors can capture expert knowledge about games like chess, that are not explicitly stated in the game's rules. ## Sentence embeddings\\[edit\\]\n\nMain article: Sentence embedding\n\nThe idea has been extended to embeddings of entire sentences or even documents, e.g. in the form of the thought vectors concept.",

In 2015, some researchers suggested \"skip-thought vectors\" as a means to improve the quality of machine translation.\\[45\\] A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures.\\[46\\] \n\n## Software\\[edit\\]\n\nSoftware for training and using word embeddings includes Tomáš Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe,\\[47\\] GN-GloVe,\\[48\\] Flair embeddings,\\[38\\] AllenNLP's ELMo,\\[49\\] BERT,\\[50\\] fastText, Gensim,\\[51\\] Indra,\\[52\\] and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters.\\[53\\] \n\n### Examples of application\\[edit\\]\n\nFor instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online.\\[54\\] \n\n## Ethical implications\\[edit\\]\n\nWord embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper “Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings” that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies.\\[55\\] For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is “man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker”.\\[56\\] \\[57\\] \n\nResearch done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases .\\[58\\]\\[59\\] \n\n## See also\\[edit\\]\n\n* Brown clustering\n* Distributional–relational database\n\n## References\\[edit\\]\n\n1.",

It included territories in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia and was ruled by emperors. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilized in civil wars and political conflicts which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching power (_imperium_) and the new title of _Augustus_, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor of a monarchy with Rome as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.\\[19\\] \n\nThe first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (lit. 'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial expanse under Trajan (r. 98–117 AD– ); a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis that threatened its existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire. It was reunified under Aurelian (r. 270–275). Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286; Christians rose to power in the 4th century after the Edict of Milan. The imperial seat moved from Rome to Byzantium in 330, renamed Constantinople after Constantine the Great. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 AD by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed.",

Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empire's adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Rome's architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque, Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture, influencing Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of classical science and technology (which formed the basis for Islamic science) in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. Many modern legal systems, such as the Napoleonic Code, descend from Roman law. Rome's republican institutions have influenced the Italian city-state republics of the medieval period, the early United States, and modern democratic republics. ## History\n\nMain article: History of the Roman Empire\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Roman history. See also: Campaign history of the Roman military and Roman Kingdom\n\nAnimated overview of the Roman territorial history from the Roman Republic until the fall of its last remnant (the Byzantine Empire) in 1453\n\n### Transition from Republic to Empire\n\nFurther information: Roman Republic\n\n_Augustus of Prima Porta_\n\nRome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an \"empire\" (a great power) long before it had an emperor.\\[21\\] The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders.",
